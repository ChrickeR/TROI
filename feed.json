            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    In the world of architecture, a significant part of our work revolves around achieving alignment and consensus. To reach this common ground and facilitate discussions, we rely heavily on various types of models.Creating a model or map is akin to crafting a tool to understand and simplify a complex reality. To truly comprehend something, we need to see the connections within it. To make these connections clear, we must simplify, highlight certain aspects, and downplay others. One particular tool that has gained prominence, or at least frequent mention, is the capability map, which directs our attention to what our company or organization does. <br><br>It's an easy topic of discussion with different parts of the business because it doesn't contain solutions and technology but elevates the discussion to another level. I have been involved in developing these maps and even transformed them into a card game used in planning meetings, sparking conversations within an operationally-oriented organization about tactical moves and goals. These discussions are essential if we are to genuinely confront the ongoing transformation in society, often referred to as digitalization.<br><br>**The Art of Creating Understanding**<br><br>As architects, our primary goal is to design structures and systems that function seamlessly and efficiently. However, achieving this isn't always straightforward, especially when you're dealing with multifaceted challenges that require collaboration and consensus among diverse stakeholders.<br><br>This is where the power of models and maps comes into play. Think of them as a cartographer's tools, helping us navigate the complex landscapes of business and technology. Just as a map simplifies a sprawling terrain into manageable proportions, models distill intricate realities into comprehensible concepts.<br><br>**The Essence of Models**<br><br>When we create a model or map, we're essentially crafting a lens through which we can view and dissect a complex reality. These models serve multiple purposes:<br><br>Simplification: Complex problems often involve numerous interrelated components. Models allow us to simplify these complexities, highlighting the most critical elements while temporarily setting aside others.<br><br>Highlighting Relationships: Models enable us to identify and visualize connections and dependencies within a system. This helps stakeholders grasp the bigger picture and how different parts of an organization fit together.<br><br>Facilitating Discussions: Models provide a common language for discussions. They transcend technical jargon and allow people from different backgrounds and departments to engage in meaningful conversations.<br><br>Alignment and Consensus: Achieving alignment and consensus is often the primary goal. Models create a shared understanding, reducing misunderstandings and conflicts.<br><br>**Understanding Business Capabilities**<br><br>Before we dive into the \"angel\" of business capabilities, let's clarify what we mean by it. A business capability defines “what” a business does at its core. This differs from “how” things are done or where they are done. Business capabilities are the core of the business architecture<br><br>![Layers of change](/assets/images/Layers.png)<br><br>**The Rise of Capability Maps**<br><br>One model that has gained prominence in recent years is the capability map. It's a tool that shifts the focus from \"how\" an organization operates to \"what\" it does. This shift is crucial, especially in the age of digital transformation, where adaptability and innovation are paramount.<br><br>Capability maps don't delve into specific solutions or technologies but rather serve as a high-level guide. They outline the core functions and activities of an organization, providing a foundation for strategic discussions. By elevating the conversation to this level, organizations can better prepare themselves to navigate the ongoing digital revolution.<br><br>![Business Capability Map, Example](/assets/images/Capabilities.png)<br><br>Source: [SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/leobarella/business-value-measurements-and-the-solution-design-framework)<br><br>**Turning Maps into Games: A Creative Approach**<br><br>I've had the privilege of participating in the creation of capability maps and even transforming them into interactive tools. One such iteration was turning a capability map into a card game that we used during planning meetings. This innovative approach transformed a highly operational and solution-oriented organization into one that discussed tactical maneuvers and long-term goals.<br><br>The card game acted as a bridge between the abstract world of capability mapping and the practical needs of the organization. It prompted discussions about strategic moves and future visions. Such discussions are crucial if we are to effectively address the ongoing transformation in society, often referred to as digitalization.<br><br><br>In the journey of digital transformation, it's easy to get lost in the technicalities of systems and processes. However, by keeping the angle of business capabilities at the forefront, you not only stay grounded in your company's essence but also remain open to the limitless possibilities that the digital age offers.<br><br>So, the next time you embark on a digital transformation initiative, remember to embrace the angle of business capabilities. Start with the \"what\" before delving into the \"how.\" In doing so, you'll find that your journey becomes more purposeful, adaptable, and ultimately, successful.<br><br>Why not sketch out your map and indicate your intended direction?\n  </p>",

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    In the year 2016, I found myself standing at the threshold of a new era—the era of digital transformation. It all began with a seemingly innocuous question posed by our CEO during a company meeting: \"Is our IT future-proof?\" Little did I know that this question would mark the beginning of a profound journey that would reshape my perspective on the role of architecture and technology in business.<br><br>Driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the implications of our CEO's inquiry, I sought guidance from experts in the field of tech and digitalization. Through a stroke of fortune, I had the privilege of connecting with influential thought leaders such as Adrian Cockcroft from Netflix and AWS, and Rodrigue Schaefer, the Head of Engineering at Zalando.<br><br>These tech visionaries shared a common sentiment—an unwavering belief in the transformative power of integrating IT as a natural part of the business. They emphasized that IT should not be treated as a separate entity but as a key differentiator, deeply ingrained in the fabric of every organization. Their words resonated deeply with me, and I couldn't help but wonder why this realization was not emanating from leadership in more organizations.<br><br>As I delved deeper into the subject, I discovered that many companies were merely scratching the surface of digital transformation. They would rebrand their traditional approaches, incorporating a few modern technologies and methodologies, but failing to grasp the true potential of digitalization. It became increasingly clear that without comprehensive comprehension and wholehearted embrace at the leadership level, the conversion to a digital-first mindset would either fail to materialize or progress at a sluggish pace.<br><br>The knowledge I gained from these influential figures and my personal experiences still hold true to this day. They emphasized the difficulties that organizations encounter when they ignore or underestimate the impact of digital transformation. In a society where technology propels progress and molds customer demands, businesses that hesitate to adopt digitalization wholeheartedly run the risk of falling behind.<br><br>Fast forward to the present day, and the importance of digital transformation has only intensified. Countless success stories abound in industries such as insurance, banking, retailing, and media, where organizations have harnessed the power of digitalization to achieve remarkable results.<br><br>Through my personal journey of digital awakening, I have come to appreciate the immense value of embracing digital transformation wholeheartedly. It is not just about adopting new technologies; it is about fundamentally shifting the mindset and culture of an organization to leverage the full potential of digital possibilities.<br><br>As we stand at the precipice of a digital revolution, it is imperative that organizations understand the profound impact digital transformation can have on their future success. Leaders must embrace the potential of technology and champion its integration within their organizations. They must foster a culture of innovation, empower their employees to embrace change, and ensure that digitalization is not merely a superficial rebranding of traditional approaches.<br><br>My personal journey of digital awakening has reinforced the significance of top management buy-in, interest, and understanding in achieving successful digital transformation. Without the occurrence of this transformation, progress will be hindered or significantly delayed.

            "content_html": "\n  <p>\n    In recent years, companies have increasingly adopted an agile approach to working and innovation, as this method has been proven to be an effective way to develop products and services quickly and effectively. However, the success of an agile approach can be hindered by a monolithic thinking and centralization.<br><br>Monolithic thinking is the idea that all aspects of a company should be managed in the same manner. This centralization of control stifles creativity and innovation, as it limits the ability of individual team members to experiment and come up with new ideas. It also slows down decision-making, as each decision must be approved by the top-level management or centralized team.<br><br>Centralization of control also hinders agility and responsiveness. With a centralized structure, teams are unable to react quickly to changes in the market or customer demands. This can lead to missed opportunities and a slower rate of product or service delivery.<br><br>Finally, monolithic thinking and centralization can also lead to increased bureaucracy and costs. Teams are often forced to adhere to rigid processes that are not tailored to the individual needs of the organization, which can lead to wastage of time and resources.<br><br>To ensure that an agile approach is successful, companies must strive for more flexible and distributed decision-making and architecture. This means that teams should be empowered to make decisions independently, so that they can react quickly to changes in the market or customer demands. Additionally, companies should strive for greater transparency and open communication between teams, so that they can collaborate effectively and speed up decision-making.<br><br>By moving away from monolithic thinking and centralization, companies can ensure that their agile approach to working and innovation is successful. This will help them to develop products and services quickly and effectively, and ensure that they remain competitive in the ever-changing business landscape.<br><br>Hidden Monoliths and Coupling: How to Identify and Mitigate Complexity in the Workplace<br><br>In today's ever-changing world of technology, understanding the concept of monoliths and coupling is vital for businesses to remain competitive. Monoliths are large, interconnected systems that are difficult to change without breaking its entire structure. Coupling is when two or more components of a system are linked, making it difficult to modify one without changing the other. Monoliths are often hidden from view, but they play a powerful role in both the digital and physical worlds. They can be found in software applications, databases, solutions, and even in the way we think about our workplaces. Monolithic structures are characterized by strong coupling, which can increase the resilience and efficiency of a system, but can also limit its ability to adapt to changing conditions. In this blog, we will explore the different types of monoliths and coupling, how they can be identified and mitigated in the workplace.<br><br>Application Monoliths: An application monolith is a single, large application that contains all the code and data needed to operate the system. It is difficult to make changes to this type of monolith without affecting its entire structure, making it hard to modify or maintain.<br><br>Joined-at-the-Database Monoliths: A joined-at-the-database monolith is a single database that contains data from multiple applications. This type of monolith is difficult to change or modify without affecting the entire system.<br><br>Monolithic Builds: A monolithic build is when all components of the system are built at the same time. This type of monolith is difficult to modify or maintain without affecting the entire system.<br><br>Monolithic Coupled Releases: A monolithic coupled release is when two or more components of the system must be released at the same time and in the right order. This type of monolith can be difficult to modify or maintain without affecting the entire system.<br><br>Another aspect of monolithic thinking is the single view of the world, standardization and one size fits all is a solutions. When it comes to problem solving, using the same tool or approach for every problem is not always the best option. Rather, the best approach is to assess the problem and determine which tool or approach will be the most effective. There are multiple tools and approaches that can be used to solve a particular problem and it's important to understand which one is the most suitable.<br><br>Monolithic Model (Single View of the World): A monolithic model is when all components of the system are viewed as a single entity. This type of monolith is difficult to modify or maintain without affecting the entire system.<br><br>Monolithic Thinking (Standardization): Monolithic thinking is when all components of the system are standardized and seen as a single entity. This type of monolith can be difficult to modify or maintain without affecting the entire system.<br><br>Monolithic Workplace: A monolithic workplace is when the entire organization is seen as a single entity. This type of monolith can be difficult to modify or maintain without affecting the entire system.<br><br>Understanding the different types of monoliths and coupling can help businesses identify and mitigate complexity in the workplace. By breaking down large, interconnected systems into smaller, more manageable components, businesses can make changes or modifications more easily and quickly. This can help businesses remain competitive and reduce their costs in the long run.<br><br>One way of doing this is the domain driven approach. Domain Driven Development and bounded context are two of the most powerful tools in software development. Both concepts help to create efficient and effective software solutions by making sure that the solution is organized around meaningful business domains.<br><br>Domain driven design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on the underlying structure of a software system and the domain it operates in. It emphasizes the importance of exploring and understanding the domain before attempting to develop a software solution. By understanding the underlying business requirements and mapping them to software elements, the development process becomes much more focused and efficient.<br><br>Bounded context is an important concept in DDD. It is the process of separating out different areas or aspects of the system and defining the boundaries between them. By doing this, the system can be divided into smaller, more manageable parts, which can be better understood and more easily maintained.<br><br>For example, consider a banking application. The application can be divided into separate bounded contexts such as customer information, accounts, payments and loan processing. Each of these bounded contexts could be further divided into smaller bounded contexts, such as customer accounts, customer payments, loan products and loan processing. By dividing the system into smaller pieces, developers can focus on what is important for each area and create more focused solutions.<br><br>Domain driven design and bounded context are extremely useful for software development. By understanding the domain and dividing the system into more manageable pieces, architects and developers can create more efficient and effective software solutions. Additionally, by reducing complexity and increasing focus, the development process becomes much faster and more efficient.<br><br>You can advantageously apply Bounded Context with a Best of breed strategy. This focuses on leveraging the best-of-breed components within a given bounded context to create the most optimized solution. By using the best-of-breed components within a given bounded context, businesses are able to create a system that is tailored to the specific needs of their users while also reducing costs and complexity. Additionally, this strategy allows businesses to quickly deploy new features and capabilities as the needs of their users evolve. Ultimately, Best of Breed with Bounded Context Focus is an effective and efficient way to create highly optimized solutions.<br><br>Monolithic structures can be beneficial, but they can also limit the ability of a system to adapt to changing conditions and hinder agile ways of working. As with any type of structure, it is important to assess the benefits and drawbacks of monolithic thinking and centralization in order to determine the best approach for your particular needs and goals.<br><br>&gt; <em>A book tip for this subject is Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais book: Team Topologies - Organizing business and technology teams for fast flow</em>\n  </p>",
