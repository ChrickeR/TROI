As Chief Architect, I had the pleasure of building and working with a very focused and driven architecture team with the size of "Two Large Pizzas" who did a amazing job together with our key bussiness stakeholders, in-house partners and development teams.

I was also a member of the IT management team and reported to CIO.

Here are some examples of the work we did while acting as change agents for the organizations digital transformation.

## Digital transformation
We worked hard to clarify the IT operational model and aligne it for the need of 
more efficient deliveries of customer value and establish IT as a value-creating 
partner in the business and not just as a supplier.

This resulted in the beginning of productization of the organization's capabilities 
together with modern agile principles, working methods and technology where IT is

documentation of architectural decisions, guiding principles and a curious coaching 
approach, which together with various business areas and delivery teams develops the 
organization's offering in "business services" based on the business capabillities.

## Collaboration and communication

As a natural part of all transformations, it required collaboration 
and clear communication and anchoring with both management and employees 
regarding changed responsibilities, competencies, delivery models. 

It also changed and developed the business processes and business offers both within the 
organization and externally.

One of the biggest changes was the creation of "Business Services", cross functional teams that included both business and developement competences to be able to act quick within a specified domain with a clear RACI model. The teams where staffed by self selection where the product owner first pitch their product and then every individual by them self selected the product the
