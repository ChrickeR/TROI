excerpt: 'How to tackle digital transformation'

Hello again! 

I think we should start here.

The terms ***digitization***, ***digitalization***, and ***digital transformation*** are often used interchangeably, but it's important to understand their distinct meanings to fully grasp the power and significance of digital transformation.

In the past, we may have used these terms inaccurately, but it's time to clarify them to avoid confusion and to be able to prioritize correctly moving forward. ***Digital transformation*** is a strategic transformation driven by customers, requiring comprehensive organizational change and the implementation of digital technologies to meet their evolving needs. On the other hand, ***digitalization*** refers to converting analog information into digital formats, while ***digitization*** involves automating processes and training employees in computer usage.

If we confuse these terms, we risk underestimating the true potential of digital transformation and the benefits it can bring to our organizations.

You who believe that digitalization is the only component of digital transformation are making a significant strategic mistake. While digitalization initiatives are essential to digital transformation, they are not the only requirement. Digital transformation demands that organizations improve their ability to handle change, making it a fundamental competency as the enterprise shifts towards becoming customer-centric. Although being agile can make ongoing digitalization initiatives more manageable, it should not be considered synonymous with them. 

In summary, digital transformation involves digitizing information, digitalizing the procedures and functions of a company's operations, and digitally transforming the organization and its strategy.

Therefore, it's crucial to start defining what digital transformation means for your organization and how it aligns with your objectives. 

If you don't have access to top-level management, find a way to connect and have an elevator pitch ready to influence potential sponsors. Leadership buy-in and understanding is critical for successful digital transformation.

Back in 2016 I just had started to work with the digital transformation and had the opportunity to meet and talk to tech and digitalization leaders such as Adrian Cockcroft (Netflix, AWS) and Rodrigue Schaefer (Head of Engineering Zalando) that even back then stressed the importance of IT being a natural part of the business and accepted as a key differentiator. They couldn't understand why this wasn't coming from leadership and emphasized the challenges of digitalization without it. Looking back, this sentiment still holds as organizations continue to implement the same process with new tools and ways of working.

Digital transformation has become a game-changer for businesses across all sectors. From manufacturing to healthcare, banking to retail, every industry is being reshaped by digital technologies. But the question is, are we ready to embrace this change? Do we have the culture and mindset to get us there?

One of the biggest challenges of this transformation is the need to let go of old ways of doing things. This includes the way we think about our businesses, our processes, our systems and even our rewards models. In the past, managers were rewarded for their headcount and the number of people they had working for them. But in the age of digitalization, this model is changing. Automation is becoming more prevalent, and companies that can automate their processes are being rewarded.

The key to success in this new digital age is speed. Companies that can move quickly and adapt to new technologies and trends will be the ones that succeed. But to do this, we need to be willing to let go of old ways of doing things and embrace new ways of working.

This means that we need to have a culture of learning and discovery. We need to be willing to try new things, take risks, and learn  fast from our mistakes. We need to be open to new ideas and perspectives, and we need to be willing to change our minds if we find a better way of doing things.

At the same time, we need to have a mindset that is focused on growth and innovation. We need to be willing to invest in new technologies and new ways of working, even if they are not yet proven. We need to be willing to take calculated risks and experiment with new ideas, and we need to be willing to pivot quickly if something is not working.

In short, the next thing to secure on this journey is not just the technology, but the culture and mindset that will help us get there. We need to be willing to embrace change, learn new skills, and work in new ways. We need to be ready to play the infinity game, where the rules are constantly changing, and the only way to win is to keep evolving.
