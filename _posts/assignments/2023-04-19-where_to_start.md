excerpt: 'How to tackle digitalization'
---
Digitalization has become a buzzword in recent years, with many organizations focusing more on the tools and way of working than the actual transformation process. While agile methodologies and team organization are valuable assets in the digitalization journey, they do not equate to digitalization itself. It requires a fundamental shift in the organization's culture and mindset towards embracing digitalization, trusting its people, and continually improving.

To start, it is essential to formulate what digitalization means for your organization and how it aligns with your goals. If you do not have access to top-level management, find a way to connect and have an elevator pitch ready to persuade potential sponsors. The importance of leadership buy-in cannot be overstated, and it is crucial to get them on board for a successful digital transformation.

In 2015, leaders in tech and digitalization such as Adrian Cockcroft and Rodrigue Schaefer stressed the need for IT to be a natural part of the business and accepted as a key differentiator. They could not understand why this wasn't coming from leadership and emphasized the challenges of digitalization without it. Looking back, this sentiment rings true as organizations continue to focus on the tools rather than the goal.

Digitalization requires a holistic approach, with business, architecture, organization, customer journeys, automation, culture, cloud, and SaaS solutions all working together for maximum value. Embracing digitalization means rethinking what we do and how we do it, from the top-level leadership to every employee in the organization.

In conclusion, digitalization is not just about using the latest tools and methodologies; it requires a fundamental shift in culture and mindset towards embracing digital transformation. Without leadership buy-in and a holistic approach to the transformation process, organizations will continue to fall behind in the digital age.
