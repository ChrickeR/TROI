excerpt: 'How to tackle digital transformation'
---
Hello again! 

Let me start here.

The terms ***digitization***, ***digitalization***, and ***digital transformation*** are often used interchangeably, but it's important to understand their distinct meanings to fully grasp the power and significance of digital transformation.

In the past, we may have used these terms inaccurately, but it's time to clarify them to avoid confusion and prioritize correctly moving forward. ***Digital transformation*** is a strategic transformation driven by customers, requiring comprehensive organizational change and the implementation of digital technologies to meet their evolving needs. On the other hand, ***digitalization*** refers to converting analog information into digital formats, while ***digitization*** involves automating processes and training employees in computer usage.

If we confuse these terms, we risk underestimating the true potential of digital transformation and the benefits it can bring to our organizations.

You who believe that digitalization is the only component of digital transformation are making a significant strategic mistake. While digitalization initiatives are essential to digital transformation, they are not the only requirement. Digital transformation demands that organizations improve their ability to handle change, making it a fundamental competency as the enterprise shifts towards becoming customer-centric. Although being agile can make ongoing digitalization initiatives more manageable, it should not be considered synonymous with them.

In summary, digital transformation involves digitizing information, digitalizing the procedures and functions of a company's operations, and digitally transforming the organization and its strategy.

Therefore, it's crucial to define what digital transformation means for your organization and how it aligns with your goals. 

If you don't have access to top-level management, find a way to connect and have an elevator pitch ready to persuade potential sponsors. Leadership buy-in is critical for successful digital transformation.

In 2016 i had the opportunity to talk to tech and digitalization leaders such as Adrian Cockcroft (Netflix, AWS) and Rodrigue Schaefer (Head of Engineering Zalando) that even back then stressed the importance of IT being a natural part of the business and accepted as a key differentiator. They couldn't understand why this wasn't coming from leadership and emphasized the challenges of digitalization without it. Looking back, this sentiment still holds as organizations continue to implement the same process with new tools and ways of working.
