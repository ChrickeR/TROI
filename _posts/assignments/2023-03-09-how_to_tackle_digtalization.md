Hey everyone!  

I'm excited to share my ideas and lessons learned on how to navigate digitalization with you in a series of blog posts. I'm eager to explore ways to Enable Digital and Being Digital with all of you.

For years, I've been working and talking to colleagues and friends about this topic, and I figured it's finally time to share my thoughts and get some wider feedback. So don't be shy - feel free to share, ask questions, and make suggestions!

When it comes to all kinds of transformation, it's important to get a fresh perspective. It's easy to get stuck in a old ruts and solutions. Taking a step back and looking at the situation from a different angle can help you identify new solutions or approaches that you may not have considered before. It's also a great way to gain insight into how others may be viewing the situation and can help you to better understand the bigger picture. As digitalization is so much more than just going paperless the fresh perspective is crutial for not ending up with what you already have in a new technical plattform. Digitalization can be a powerful tool to help businesses become more efficient and increase their productivity. Digitalization can also help to reduce costs, improve customer service, and create new opportunities for innovation. It can also open up new markets and create new revenue streams. It's an exciting time for businesses to take advantage of digitalization and all the benefits it can bring.

Digitalization is a hot topic these days; and has been for several years. But what is it and how can it help your organization? The answer starts with understanding where your organization is heading and why before designing how. What is the vision and direction? What are the expectations? Once you have a clear idea of this, you can begin to think about how digitalization can help you get there. Without a clear target, it's hard to aim. But when the target is clear, it's time to "Plan Your Work & Work Your Plan". Digitalization offers huge potential for organizations, but it's important to remember that there is no silver bullet. Every organization is different and will have different needs. It's important to assess what works best for you and build a plan that fits your specific needs. That way, you can make sure that you're getting the most out of digitalization.

So with that said, what is ***Digitalization***?

For me digitalization is about more than just technology. It’s about how you can use technology to stay agile and adapt to the ever-changing landscape. It’s about how you can use the latest technologies to improve efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, and unlock new opportunities.  But it is also about people and culture, collaboration, trust, staffing, curiosity and learning.

It is becoming increasingly clear that IT is not the central focus of digitalization, but rather a natural part of the business. Companies must embrace technology in order to stay competitive, and the future of business will be digital in its core. 

So digitalization is about more than just investing in new technology; it is about changing the way a business works and how it interacts with its customers. It involves rethinking processes, re-engineering operations, and creating new customer experiences. This means that IT is not central to digitalization, but rather an enabler of it.

Businesses that embrace digitalization need to look beyond traditional IT solutions. They need to focus on how technology can be used to create new opportunities and improve customer experience. This could mean investing in new software, implementing automation, or leveraging data analytics to gain insights.

Ultimately, digitalization is not just about technology, but about transforming the way a business operates. IT is an important part of this process, but it is not the only element. Businesses need to think holistically about digitalization and embrace technology as a natural part of their business.

I'm going to break it down into pieces and explore each piece in a series of blog posts. I'm looking forward to this journey and I hope you'll join me as I explore this topic!

**Digital Transformation is hard!**

In the upcoming blog posts, I'm looking forward to sharing my personal experiences, observations, and analysis with you. I will strive to provide helpful guidance and suggest standards and boundaries where necessary, all while keeping an open mind and allowing for flexibility in the process. I'm sure this journey will be filled with learning and growth for us all.

The next post will cover where I suggest to start and why...

See you soon :)
