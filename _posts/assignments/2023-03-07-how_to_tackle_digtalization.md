Hey everyone!  

I am thrilled to accept the challenge of adressing Digital Transformation in a series of blog posts. I'm looking forward to exploring ways to Enable Digital and Being Digital with a fresh perspective.

For years, I've been working and talking to colleagues and friends about this topic, and I figured it's finally time to share my thoughts and get some feedback. So don't be shy - feel free to share, ask questions, and make suggestions!

Digitalization is a hot topic these days; and has been for several years. But what is it and how can it help your organization? The answer starts with understanding where your organization is heading and why before designing how. What is the vision and direction? What are the expectations? Once you have a clear idea of this, you can begin to think about how digitalization can help you get there. Without a clear target, it's hard to aim. But when the target is clear, it's time to "Plan Your Work & Work Your Plan". Digitalization offers huge potential for organizations, but it's important to remember that there is no silver bullet. Every organization is different and will have different needs. It's important to assess what works best for you and build a plan that fits your specific needs. That way, you can make sure that you're getting the most out of digitalization.

So with that said, what is ***Digitalization***?

For me digitalization is about more than just technology. It’s about how you can use technology to stay agile and adapt to the ever-changing landscape. It’s about how you can use the latest technologies to improve efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, and unlock new opportunities.  But it is also about people and culture, collaboration, trust, staffing, curiosity and learning.

I'm going to break it down into two parts and explore each part in a series of blog posts. First, I'm going to look at how to Enable Digital, and then I'm going to explore Being Digital. I'm looking forward to this journey and I hope you'll join me as I explore this topic!


**Digital Transformation is hard!**

In the upcoming blog posts, I'm looking forward to sharing my personal experiences, observations, and analysis with you. I will strive to provide helpful guidance and suggest standards and boundaries where necessary, all while keeping an open mind and allowing for flexibility in the process. I'm sure this journey will be filled with learning and growth for us all.

The next post will cover where I suggest to start and why...

See you soon :)
