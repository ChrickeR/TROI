excerpt: 'Empowered teams is key for driving innovation'
---
We live in an ever-changing world and having guiding principles and visions to help navigate day to day work, decisions, and empower teams is key for driving innovation. These guardrails help steer towards a unified goal for everyone in the organization, allowing teams to come together around a shared purpose. 

Having a guiding principle and vision for your team is an essential part of keeping it on track and empowering it to succeed. It helps you to focus on the big picture, as well as providing a shared goal that everyone can work towards. 

The most important part of having a guiding principle and vision is that it should be personalized to your team’s unique goals, strengths, weaknesses, and dynamics. Every team is different so what works for one may not work for another; so take the time to think about what would best serve your specific needs. Think about what values are important to you as an individual or organization, such as innovation, creativity, or collaboration. Then use those values to craft your guiding principle or vision statement that will help bring the team together around these shared principles. 

When creating theese guard-rails for your team or organization, I encourage us all to take the time to think deeply about what our goals are and what values we want to hold ourselves accountable for. From this foundation of clarity, it will be much easier for us all to make decisions with confidence. 

At the same time, I believe that having guiding principles and visions should not stifle creativity or innovation. Instead, they should act as boundaries that help ensure we are working towards common objectives in an efficient manner. This way everyone on the team can feel empowered to contribute their ideas without worrying about straying too far from our core mission and values. 

Your guiding principle should also be communicated clearly and often with all members of the team – not just when something goes wrong but also when things are going right too!

Overall the goal is for us all have an understanding of where we are going and how we want to get there together - so let's use these guard-rails as tools for success!
