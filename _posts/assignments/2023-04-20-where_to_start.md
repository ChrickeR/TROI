-   Maybe you do not have the understanding and support from your top leadership.
-   You could be struggling to comprehend what digital transformation entails and how your objectives align with it.
-   It's possible that you are finding it challenging to cultivate a growth and innovation-focused mindset.
-   You may be stuck in an IT-centric focus and find it challenging to step back and remember that technology itself is not the end goal.
-   Perhaps you are finding it difficult to let go of old ways of doing things.
-   You might want guidance on how to structure, foster trust, and cultivate a culture of agility.
-   Or maybe you are simply curious.

I will do my best to provide my perspective on each of these why's in the hopes that it will pique your interest and encourage you to delve deeper into the subject matter.

## So why care - It is just semantics or ?

Communication is an essential part of our daily lives, whether it's at home, work or social situations. However, communication can sometimes be a challenge when we assume that we are talking about the same thing. It's a common behavior that we all engage in, but it can cause a lot of confusion and slow down the process.

The impact of miscommunication can be felt in all industries. With the rise of digital technologies, many terms and concepts have emerged, and it can be challenging to differentiate them. For instance, terms such as digitization, digitalization, digital transformation, and digital business transformation are often used interchangeably, and sometimes carelessly simplified and merged into digital transformation or digitalization, leading to confusion.

When we assume that we are talking about the same thing, we create expectations that may differ from each other. This can lead to misunderstandings and disagreements, which can be frustrating for everyone involved. For example, if two colleagues are discussing a project, but they have different interpretations of the goals and objectives, their expectations for the project's outcome will differ. This can lead to confusion and conflict, making it challenging to move forward.

It's essential to take the time to clarify what we mean when discussing digital transformation to avoid such scenarios. Having a common understanding of terms and concepts can ensure that everyone is on the same page, and expectations are aligned. Moreover, it can lead to better collaboration and faster implementation of digital transformation initiatives.

In conclusion, miscommunication can have a significant impact on digital transformation projects, leading to delays, misunderstandings, frustration  and disagreements. Therefore, it's crucial to take the time to clarify what we mean when discussing digital transformation to ensure that everyone is on the same page. By doing so, we can avoid confusion, align expectations, prioritize and accelerate the implementation of digital transformation initiatives.

My experience is that this is often is the case when we come to digital transformation and digitalization. 

## So what is "Digital Transformation"

### Digitization
Digitization refers to the process of converting analog data into digital format, also known as digital enablement. This can include scanning physical documents and converting them into PDF files or creating digital copies of photographs. Digitization is an important first step in the digital transformation process, as it allows for the storage and manipulation of data in a digital format.

### Digitalization
Digitalization, on the other hand, refers to the use of digital technologies to transform business operations. This can include implementing digital tools and processes to streamline workflows and increase efficiency. Digitalization is focused on using technology to optimize existing processes and drive business growth.

### Digital Transformation
Digital transformation is a broader term that encompasses both digitization and digitalization. It refers to the process of using digital technologies to fundamentally change how a business operates. This can include rethinking business models and processes to leverage new technologies and create new value propositions for customers.

### Digital Business Transformation
Digital business transformation is a term that is often used to describe the process of using digital technologies to transform an entire business. This can include everything from digitizing business processes to implementing new digital business models.

### Wrapping up
In the past, we may have used these terms imprecisely, but it's time to differentiate them to avoid misunderstandings. 

***Digital transformation*** is a customer-driven strategic transformation that necessitates comprehensive organizational change and the adoption of digital technologies to meet evolving needs. On the other hand, ***Digital Business Transformation***  refers to the process of utilizing digital technologies and capabilities to create a robust new digital business model.

Furthermore, ***digitization*** pertains to converting analog information into digital formats, while ***digitalization*** involves modifying business models to provide new revenue and value-producing opportunities by automating processes and training employees in computer usage.

In summary, digital transformation involves digitizing information, digitalizing the procedures and functions of a company's operations, and digitally transforming the organization and its strategy.

Therefore, it's crucial to start defining what digital transformation means for your organization and how it aligns with your objectives.

### The importance of top management buy in, interest and understanding
*Back in 2016 I just had started to work with the digital transformation and had the opportunity to meet and talk to tech and digitalization leaders such as Adrian Cockcroft (Netflix, AWS) and Rodrigue Schaefer (Head of Engineering Zalando) that even back then stressed the importance of IT being a natural part of the business and accepted as a key differentiator. They couldn’t understand why this wasn’t coming from leadership and emphasized the challenges of digitalization without retrospect, this sentiment remains relevant because numerous organizations merely rebrand their traditional approaches and persist in executing the same processes with a slight incorporation of modern technologies and methodologies. Without comprehensive comprehension at the leadership level, the conversion will either fail to materialize or progress at a sluggish pace.*
