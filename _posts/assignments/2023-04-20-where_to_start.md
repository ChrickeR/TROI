Hello again!

**Why writing this blog post**
Let's begin by exploring the reasons why you may find this subject matter intriguing:

-   Perhaps you feel that your transformation is progressing too slowly or lacks the necessary attention.
-   Maybe you do not have the understanding and support from your top leadership.
-   You could be struggling to comprehend what digital transformation entails and how your objectives align with it.
-   It's possible that you are finding it challenging to cultivate a growth and innovation-focused mindset.
-   You may be stuck in an IT-centric focus and find it challenging to step back and remember that technology itself is not the end goal.
-   Perhaps you are finding it difficult to let go of old ways of doing things.
-   You might want guidance on how to structure, foster trust, and cultivate a culture of agility.
-   Or maybe you are simply curious.

I will do my best to provide my perspective on each of these why's in the hopes that it will pique your interest and encourage you to delve deeper into the subject matter.

**How to get speed and the necessary attention to digital transformation**  
If you don't have access to top-level management, find a way to connect and have an elevator pitch ready to influence potential sponsors. Leadership buy-in and understanding is critical for successful digital transformation.

Back in 2016 I just had started to work with the digital transformation and had the opportunity to meet and talk to tech and digitalization leaders such as Adrian Cockcroft (Netflix, AWS) and Rodrigue Schaefer (Head of Engineering Zalando) that even back then stressed the importance of IT being a natural part of the business and accepted as a key differentiator. They couldn't understand why this wasn't coming from leadership and emphasized the challenges of digitalization without it.In retrospect, this sentiment remains relevant because numerous organizations merely rebrand their traditional approaches and persist in executing the same processes with a slight incorporation of modern technologies and methodologies. Without comprehensive comprehension at the leadership level, the conversion will either fail to materialize or progress at a sluggish pace.

**How to get  understanding and support from your top leadership**
Digital transformation has become a game-changer for businesses across all sectors. From manufacturing to healthcare, banking to retail, every industry is being reshaped by digital technologies. But the question is, are we ready to embrace this change? Do we have the culture and mindset to get us there?

One of the biggest challenges of this transformation is the need to let go of old ways of doing things. This includes the way you think about your businesses, your processes, your organization or your systems and even your rewards models. In the past, managers were rewarded for their headcount and the number of people they had working for them. But in the age of digitalization, this model should change. Automation is becoming more prevalent, and companies that can automate their processes are being rewarded.

If the leadership believe that digitalization is the only component of digital transformation they are making a significant strategic mistake. While digitalization initiatives are essential to digital transformation, they are not the only requirement. Digital transformation demands that organizations improve their ability to handle change, making it a fundamental competency as the enterprise shifts towards becoming customer-centric. 

Although being agile can make ongoing digitalization initiatives more manageable, it should not be considered synonymous with them.

**How to comprehend what digital transformation entails and how your objectives align with it**

One aspect that has been puzzling to me is the terminology and shared understanding of what we mean by digital transformation. To establish a common foundation, clarify these terms to avoid confusion and ensure correct prioritization moving forward.

The terms _digitization_, _digitalization_, _digital transformation_, and _digital business transformation_ are often used interchangeably, but it's essential to comprehend their unique meanings to fully grasp the significance of digital transformation.

In the past, we may have used these terms imprecisely, but it's time to differentiate them to avoid misunderstandings. _**Digital transformation**_ is a customer-driven strategic transformation that necessitates comprehensive organizational change and the adoption of digital technologies to meet evolving needs. On the other hand, _**Digital business transformation**_ refers to the process of utilizing digital technologies and capabilities to create a robust new digital business model.

Furthermore, _**digitization**_ pertains to converting analog information into digital formats (also known as digital enablement), while _**digitalization**_ involves modifying business models to provide new revenue and value-producing opportunities by automating processes and training employees in computer usage.

Misunderstanding these terms may cause us to underestimate the true potential of digital transformation and the benefits it can offer your organizations. It may also lead to bad prioritazion and slow down the transformation.

In summary, digital transformation involves digitizing information, digitalizing the procedures and functions of a company's operations, and digitally transforming the organization and its strategy.

Therefore, it's crucial to start defining what digital transformation means for your organization and how it aligns with your objectives.

**How to let go of old ways of doing things**

The key to success in this new digital age is speed. Companies that can move quickly and adapt to new technologies and trends will be the ones that succeed. But to do this, we need to be willing to let go of old ways of doing things and embrace new ways of working.

This means that we need to have a culture of learning and discovery. We need to be willing to try new things, take risks, and learn fast from our mistakes. We need to be open to new ideas and perspectives, and we need to be willing to change our minds if we find a better way of doing things.

At the same time, we need to have a mindset that is focused on growth and innovation. We need to be willing to invest in new technologies and new ways of working, even if they are not yet proven. We need to be willing to take calculated risks and experiment with new ideas, and we need to be willing to pivot quickly if something is not working.

In short, the next thing to secure on this journey is not just the technology, but the culture and mindset that will help us get there. We need to be willing to embrace change, learn new skills, and work in new ways. We need to be ready to play the infinity game, where the rules are constantly changing, and the only way to win is to keep evolving.
