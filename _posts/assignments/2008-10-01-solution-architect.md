As a solution architect I focused on insurance and customer communications.

Here is some examples of the work.

## Customer communication

Provided and implemented solutions for notifications to digital mailboxes to letters in the customer preferred channel.

Another solution covered automation of incoming insurance claims and additions to insurance matters.

But the biggest achievement in this role was to prove the value of the customer self-service web solution that handled insurance claims, 
customer vase status and correspondence. It also supported case supplements and automations in the claims process.
