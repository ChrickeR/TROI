excerpt: 'How to tackle digitalization'
---

I had previously promised to explain where to begin when it comes to digitalization and why. To start, digitalization is not a task solely for the IT department; it is something that involves the entire organization. It will necessitate changes in how we do things, organize, and in some cases, our business model. If you agree with this, then where do you begin? From my own experiences, I can attest to the fact that it is a long and difficult journey, especially if the other party does not share your vision and finds the concept unconvincing, since it comes from IT. 

Back in 2016, I had the privilege of attending the GOTO Conference in Stockholm, where I got the opportunity to speak to both Adrian Cockcroft (Netflix, AWS) and Rodrigue Schaefer (Head of Engineering Zalando), two very inspiring tech and digitalization leaders.

Both of them smiled and responded with a rhetorical question like: "What do you mean, isn't this coming from the leadershipâ€¦ Well, before you give up hope, looking back at Adrian's speech, it seems like this is exactly what we had failed to communicate."

>The irony of the GOTO conference is that it is a conference for Developers, by Developers
