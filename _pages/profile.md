    excerpt: "With a profound passion for digitalization, technology, and efficiency, my journey has been defined by a relentless pursuit of innovation that serves the interests of businesses, users, customers, and even my own daily routines. With over two decades entrenched in the realm of Information Technology, I have embraced diverse leadership roles that have shaped my expertise and perspective.
    <br/><br/>
    During my tenure spanning 20+ years, I've been at the helm of crucial endeavors, most recently as a consultant contributing my skills to prestigious entities like Telia and TV4. Prior to this, I held pivotal positions, including that of Head of Architecture and Chief Architect. Notably, my role in the digital transformation of Afa Insurance stands as a testament to my influence in architecting IT     
    strategic frameworks and management systems that have paved the way for the organization's digital odyssey.
    <br/><br/>
    Eager for new challenges, my appetite for growth remains insatiable—no task is too monumental or trivial. I invite you to explore my portfolio at www.TROI.se or connect with me directly. Let's embark on a shared journey toward innovation and excellence."
